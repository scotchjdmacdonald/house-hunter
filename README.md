# Check out [House Hunter](http://househunterfe.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/#/)!

### Application I built whilst looking for an apartment in Amsterdam with my partner.

### Got a bit sick of having to look on different websites all the time ðŸ˜‰.


NodeJs with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) backend, used by this [Vue-Cli
(https://github.com/scotchjdmacdonald/house-hunter-fe) front end.

Built and deployed to AWS's [ElasticBeanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) using [Travis CI](travis-ci.org) (check out the .travis.yml).
